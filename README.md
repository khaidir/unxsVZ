## uxnsVZ

Internet service provider eco system based on async job queues simply and effectively provided by MySQL itself.

Most of the software was generated by unxsRAD directly from MySQL schema. 
It is simple C with libmysql for small one shot cgi programs (no fastcgi style daemons required, no memory leak issues),
therefore Apache is used instead of nginx.

Slowly moving from these cost effective old school backends by unxsRAD to JQuery/Bootstrap client side interfaces.

### Project Status

Many of the sub dirs are standalone projects that are no longer being actively developed.

Recently moved all development and tracking to GitHub this will help setup the sub dir projects as individual projects as soon as time permits.

The unxsVZ multi datacenter virtualization and DevOps tool is not in a production ready state.
Other VMs (and container) support for GCE, DigitalOcean, AWS and Docker (direct and via Rancher) is being added slowly
and has broken most everything.

### Install instructions

1-. Clone unxs0/unxsVZ GitHub repository on an Ubuntu or CentOS server.
2-. Install required libs and unxsVZ tools like unxsAdmin.
3-. Install and harden MySQL.

### Production instructions

You should only use encrypted tunnels for MySQL traffic between remote servers and the MySQL db cluster.
