## Basic w2ui framework using MySQL driven C backend.

The idea is to learn how to use this JS framework. Using the work product
as a starting point for real apps.

### Roadmap

1-. Add/Mod/Del MySQL data.
2-. Click on row data to open other editors or wizard like work flows.
3-. Use tabs for different tables.
4-. Auto generate code for tabs and grid editors from MySQL schema.
