Setting up docker-compose environment for the automation of container metrics
per docker resource usage limit settings (docker runtime constraints on resources).

Currently documented constraints:

--memory=""	Memory limit (format: <number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of b, k, m, or g. Minimum is 4M.
--memory-swap=""	Total memory limit (memory + swap, format: <number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of b, k, m, or g.
--memory-reservation=""	Memory soft limit (format: <number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of b, k, m, or g.
--kernel-memory=""	Kernel memory limit (format: <number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of b, k, m, or g. Minimum is 4M.
--cpu-shares=0	CPU shares (relative weight)
--cpu-period=0	Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period
--cpuset-cpus=""	CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
--cpuset-mems=""	Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.
--cpu-quota=0	Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota
--blkio-weight=0	Block IO weight (relative weight) accepts a weight value between 10 and 1000.
--blkio-weight-device=""	Block IO weight (relative device weight, format: DEVICE_NAME:WEIGHT)
--device-read-bps=""	Limit read rate from a device (format: <device-path>:<number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of kb, mb, or gb.
--device-write-bps=""	Limit write rate to a device (format: <device-path>:<number>[<unit>]). Number is a positive integer. Unit can be one of kb, mb, or gb.
--device-read-iops=""	Limit read rate (IO per second) from a device (format: <device-path>:<number>). Number is a positive integer.
--device-write-iops=""	Limit write rate (IO per second) to a device (format: <device-path>:<number>). Number is a positive integer.
--oom-kill-disable=false	Whether to disable OOM Killer for the container or not.
--oom-score-adj=0	Tune container.s OOM preferences (-1000 to 1000)
--memory-swappiness=""	Tune a container.s memory swappiness behavior. Accepts an integer between 0 and 100.
--shm-size=""	Size of /dev/shm. The format is <number><unit>. number must be greater than 0. Unit is optional and can be b (bytes), k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), or g (gigabytes). If you omit the unit, the system uses bytes. If you omit the size entirely, the system uses 64m.

We can also load the server, in general, using "stress" containers in order to understand
how differect sets of resource usage limits impact our service containers when container hogs exist. This is especially important when
trying to set relative weight parameters like --cpu-shares and --blkio-weight.

The focus is on PostgreSQL and Odoo ERP container services.

We would like to learn how to isolate resource hog containers from affecting the others.

Base CPU Test
Base Memory Test
Base IO Stress Test
Base Disk Read Test
Base Disk Write Test

Example:
# cd stress-basic;docker-compose -f cpuallsamecpu50percent.a.yml up
